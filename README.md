###To run the project:

##Technologies:

1. HTML5 - for basic structuring of our web site.
2. CCS3 - to style our web site.
3. JavaScript - to manipulate HTML, e.g. the drop-down list in the navigation bar.
4. PHP - to view our HTML code when running on a server.
5. XML - to structure/describe some of the data for our web site.
6. jQuery - a JavaScript library that makes it easier to use JavaScript.
7. Font Awesome - for awesome scalable vector icons.
8. Google Fonts - a huge collection of open source web fonts.

###1. HTML5

HTML5 is used to structure our web site.

###2. CSS3

CSS3 is used to style the HTML code so that our site looks more appealing as
well as it make it more user friendly.

###3. JavaScript

JavaScript is used to manipulate the HTML code in our project. E.g. to make the
drop-down lists in the navigation bar interactive. The drop-down lists
extends/open when they are clicked.

###4. PHP

PHP is a server side scripting language for hosting web pages.
The way PHP works is that it renders the HTML files so that they are viewed
just as if you would open them normally.

###5. XML

We have used XML to structure/describe the list of inhabitants and board members
in the housing association. This makes it easy to store and change the data in a
proper way compared to using HTML.

###6. jQuery

We have used jQuery to change classes for some HTML code, to make the styling
different when the drop-down lists are clicked.

###7. Font Awesome

Font Awesome is a CSS toolkit that allows us to use scalable vector icons in
our web site. E.g. the house icon in the navigation bar. The icons are very easy
to style with CSS and does not require the use of JavaScript. It also has lot
of other features like compatibility with screen readers, infinite scalability
(because the icons are vectors) and it now has a total of 479 icons.

###8. Google Fonts

Google Font is a huge collection of open source web fonts. We have imported
the Open Sans-family in to our project from Google Fonts.
